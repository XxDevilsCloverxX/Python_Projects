# Using a list of tuples of the function, its derivative, and varying initial guesses.

#Problem 2 text description:
    # Using the provided function h(x) = x^5-5x^3+4x+1 and the derivative,
    #   5x^4 -15x^2 + 4, a selected starting point can converge using newtons method
    #   and an approxomated root can be returned. At x_0 = {1, 2, 3}, the root converges at
    #   1.95407961.. (approxomated). At x_0 = -5, the approxomated root was -2.03849529, and for
    #    x_0 = 0 yielded an approxomated root of -.27583419
    #   for an x_0 =1000, the function exceeded trial limit.
